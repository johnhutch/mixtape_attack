<p>Despite the hundreds of music blogs and review sites, they are so segmented, so unintuitive, so pretentious or specific or inconsistent, there's still no one place to go to find out about your favorite black metal band in the same breath as the new Fleet Foxes; a site that learns who you are and what you like based on how you rate genres, artists, and albums yet still maintains the editorial cache of a staff of music junkie writers and reviewers like a pre-labelwhore Rolling Stone or NME.</p>

<p>Crowd sourcing alone is not enough to find out about music and that's why Last.FM fails. At best, you can only find out what everyone has already been listening to, never what you might like tomorrow. That's what we hope to build with Mixtape Attack. By establishing a hierarchy of trust between our readers and our writing staff and giving them the technology to make the most of that trust, we think we can become a moving force in online music.</p>

<p>So, in short... we're gonna make a music review site where we can freak out about our favorite albums. It'll be awesome, I swear.</p>
